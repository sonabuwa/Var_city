    <p>Varanasi, or Benaras, (also known as Kashi) is one of the oldest living cities in the world. Varanasi`s
      Prominence in Hindu mythology is virtually unrevealed The land of Varanasi (Kashi) has been the ultimate
      pilgrimage spot for Hindus for ages. Hindus believe that one who is graced to die on the land of Varanasi would
      attain salvation and freedom from the cycle of birth and re-birth. <br></p>

    <p>Varanasi has also been a great center of learning for ages. Varanasi is associated with promotion of
      spiritualism, mysticism, Sanskrit, yoga and Hindi language and honored authors such as the ever-famous novelist
      Prem Chand and Tulsi Das, the famous saint-poet who wrote Ram Charit Manas. </p>

    <p>In the Rigveda, an ancient Indian sacred collection of Vedic Sanskrit hymns, the city is referred to as Kāśī
      (काशी:Kashi) from the Sanskrit verbal root kaś- "to shine", making Varanasi known as "City of Light", the
      "luminous city as an eminent seat of learning".</p>

    <p>According to Hindu mythology, Varanasi was founded by Shiva, one of three principal deities along with Brahma and
      Vishnu. During a fight between Brahma and Shiva, one of Brahma's five heads was torn off by Shiva. As was the
      custom, the victor carried the slain adversary's head in his hand and let it hang down from his hand as an act of
      ignominy, and a sign of his own bravery. A bridle was also put into the mouth. Shiva thus dishonored Brahma's
      head, and kept it with him at all times. When he came to the city of Varanasi in this state, the hanging head of
      Brahma dropped from Shiva's hand and disappeared in the ground. Varanasi is therefore considered an extremely holy
      site.</p>
